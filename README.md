# 100DaysOfMLCode

## Day 0: 14th July 2018
I've just created this repository and I'm learning how to properly use GitHub, watching the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Loav1kbA640 . I've also studied the math about linear regression. 

## Day 1: 15th July 2018
I've created a python linear regressor with just Numpy and plot the greph with the training slope and interceppt. 

## Day 2: 16th July 2018
Svm classifier and kernel trick. Code needs to be improved. 

## Day 3: 17th July 2018
Improvements on svm model.

## Day 4: 18th July 2018
I developed a K-Means classifier and posted it on GitHub.

## Day 5: 19th July 2018
Some code cleaning on K-Means. I started studying Decision Trees and Random Forest.

## Day 6: 20th July 2018

## Day 7: 21th July 2018

## Day 8: 22th July 2018

## Day 9: 23th July 2018
### Work: 
Today I've watched the video 'Probability Theory - The Math of Intelligence #6' by Siraj Raval and with some other website I've built a simple Naive Bayes classifier. 
### Thoughts: 
I have to apply it to real world data.

## Day 10: 24th July 2018
### Work: 
Performing Sentiment Analysis with a Naive Bayes model on review on books from the Amazon's platform.

## Day 14: 28th July 2018

## Day 15: 29th July 2018
### Work: 
Starting read the book "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow et al. 
### Thoughts: 
I have to understand deeply the math behind the model that I apply.

## Day 16: 30th July 2018
### Work: 
Studying some more Math on 'Deep Learning'.
### Link: 
Same of yesterday.

## Day 17: 31th July 2018
### Work: 
Still studying math from 'Deep Learning'. Developing a spamm filter based on Naive Bayes classifier. 
### Thoughts: 
I need more data preprocessing skills.

## Day 18: 1st August 2018
### Work: 
Watched some videos about Neural Network and backpropagation and starting developing a neural network with just NNumpy. 
### Thoughts: 
Understaing ML concepts but still struggling with Python, I have to improve on this.

## Day 19: 2nd August 2018
### Work: 
After some problems, I finally managed to realize a NN with just Numpy, thanks to a post on TowardsDataScience. It's been difficult but very useful, now I want to try developing some other ML algorithm with classes in Python. 
### Thoughts: 
while (code doesn't work):
  fix it
