# 100DaysOfMLCode

## Day 0: 14th July 2018
I've just created this repository and I'm learning how to properly use GitHub, watching the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Loav1kbA640 . I've also studied the math about linear regression. 

## Day 1: 15th July 2018
I've created a python linear regressor with just Numpy and plot the greph with the training slope and interceppt. 

## Day 2: 16th July 2018
Svm classifier and kernel trick. Code needs to be improved. 

## Day 3: 17th July 2018
Improvements on svm model.

## Day 4: 18th July 2018
I developed a K-Means classifier and posted it on GitHub.

## Day 5: 19th July 2018
Some code cleaning on K-Means. I started studying Decision Trees and Random Forest.

## Day 15: 29th July 2018
### Work: 
Starting read the book "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow et al. 
### Thoughts: 
I have to understand deeply the math behind the model that I apply.
